\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

This work implements the SMDP version of UCRL algorithm as ideated by Fruit et al. \cite{fruit_regret_2017}.
Our implementation is open source and is available \href{https://github.com/say4n/options}{here} for use.
We observe sub-linear accumulated regret for the grid world domain using empirical Bernstein confidence bounds.
There are several ways possible ways to extend our present work.
It includes trying out different classes of confidence bounds and observing the changes in accumulate regret and reward as compared to our present work.
There are possible improvements in the runtime of the simulation execution to be had by exploiting parallelization of the simulations, presently they are executed in a sequential manner.
As each simulation is independent from the other simulations, this is a plausible first step in improvement.
